Nom
Tuis edition of the lst book of Livy has been prepared

especially for the uso of those who, in connection with the care·
ful study of some part of Livy, wish another part for more
rapid reading. The boolr lends itself readily to such a pur·
pose. Tha subject is interesting, the incidente varied and
picturasque, and few passages offer unusual grammatical diffi-
culties. Το aid in the reading, the notes have beon placed at
the foot of the page. All critical matter has beon omitted
from them, as also have been all longer explanatione, except
such as occasionally seemed important for cloarness of under-
standing. They contain more than the mere translation of

words and phrases, but not, it is hoped‚ more than is necessary .

for an intelligent though rapid reading of the book. The long
syllables have been marked to aid in the pronunciation of the
Latin. The text is that of the second edition of Dr. Merita
Mhbllserthe object of this edition isto supply a part of Livy ior

rapid reading, it is bound up with the 2101 and aad books. It ¹

is also issned separatsly for use with any other part of Livy or
with another author.

lems connected with the period, the following worlrs are sug-
gested for reference: Mommsan’s History of Rome, Vol. 1.;
Niebuhr’s History of Rome, Vols. 1., Π.; Ihne’s History of
Rorae, Vol. 1.; Dyer’s History of the Kiaya of Rome,· Sir G. C.
Lawis's Oa lte Credibilityrof Early Roman History; and J. R.
Seeley’s Livy, -Bks i.-x., Introduction.

chief of the 101100, for valuable suggestions and for care in
