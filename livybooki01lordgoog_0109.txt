Thi· Series will contain the Latin authors usually read in Ameil-
can schools and colleges, and also others well adopted to class-roem
use, but not as yet published in suitable editions. The several
volumes will be prepared by special editors, who will aim to revise
the text oareiully and to edit it in the most serviceable manner.
Where there are German editions oi unusual merit, representing
years oi special study under the most favorable circumstances,
these will be used, with the consent oi the foreign editor, as a basis
ior the American edition. In this way it will be possible to bring
out text-books oi the highest excellence in a comparatively short
period oi time.

The editions will be oi two kinds, conforming to the different
methods oi studying Latin in our best institutione. Some will
contain in the introductione and commentary such a careiul and
minute treatment oi the author's life, language, and style as to
afford the means ior a thorough appreciation oi the author and his
place in Latin literature. Others will aim merely to assist the
student to a good reading knowledge oi the author, and will have
only the text and briei explanatory notes at the bottom oi each
page. The latter will be particularly acceptable ior sight reading,
and lor rapid reading aiter the minute study oi an author or period
in one oi the luller editions For instance, alter a class has read
a play or two oi Plautus and Terence careiully, with special refer·'
ence to the peculiarities oi style, language, metres, the methods
oi presenting a play, and the like, these editions will be admirably
suited ior the rapid reading oi other plays.

The Series will also contain various supplementary works pre-

pared by competent scholare. Every effort will be made to give Ι

the books a neat and attractive appearance.
